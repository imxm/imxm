**CEO & Head of Engineering at [BlockApex](https://blockapex.io) | Blockchain Security Auditor at [OakSecurity](https://www.oaksecurity.io/) & [Quill Audits](https://www.quillaudits.com/)**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Moazzam Arif, the CEO and Head of Engineering at BlockApex, a security-first blockchain consultation firm. My expertise lies in blockchain security auditing, tokenomics design, and developing robust blockchain infrastructure. Over the course of my career, I‚Äôve audited over 100 projects and analyzed approximately 500,000 lines of code, ensuring that distributed systems are secure, scalable, and efficient.

## üöÄ BlockApex: A Comprehensive Blockchain Consultation Firm

At BlockApex, we've developed three verticals to encompass the complete lifecycle of blockchain and distributed apps:

### 1. Token Engineering
Our Token Engineering team consists of experts in finance/quants, economics, distributed system design, and formal methods. Unlike most security auditing firms, we focus on economic attacks‚Äîan area often overlooked but critical to the security of DeFi protocols.

- **Services:** 
  - Econometrics through the QTM framework
  - Liquidity bootstrapping/provisioning using LBP by Balancer
  - Optimized incentive mechanisms and yield farming
  - Mechanism Design using ABM techniques
  - Tokenomics Audits through Monte Carlo simulations, ABMs, stress testing, and scenario-based testing
- **Research Focus:** DeFi, exchanges on EVM, Cosmos, and NEAR blockchain, AVS, governance, RWA, consensus design, formal verification, and AMM design.



### 2. BlockApex Labs
Our Labs division focuses on blockchain infrastructure and dApp development on EVM, Cosmos, NEAR, and Solana. We adopt a security-first approach, integrating security audits and threat modeling at every stage of development.

- **Industries Served:** DeFi (AMMs, intents settlement, DSL for intents, cross-border decentralized payment solutions), X-to-earn platforms, TON games, RWA frameworks, and ongoing L2 projects.
- **Development Philosophy:** Each iteration is threat modeled and validated by security auditors and token engineers. Our auditors turned developers bring a deep understanding of open-source projects, enabling the creation of high-quality, testable, and debuggable code.

### 3. Security and Audits
With over 100 projects audited, our Security and Audits vertical is dedicated to uncovering vulnerabilities and securing blockchain protocols. Notable findings and case studies will be available here soon.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills

- **Blockchain Development:** Solidity, Rust, CosmWasm, Smart Contract Development
- **Security Audits:** Vulnerability assessment, Threat modeling, Formal verification
- **Tokenomics:** Design and analysis, Liquidity provisioning, Mechanism design, Incentive mechanisms
- **Distributed Systems:** EVM, Cosmos, NEAR, Solana, Layer 2 solutions
- **Software Engineering:** Microservices, SaaS tools, Cloud-centric solutions
- **Programming Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust


### Token Engineering
- **DeFi Research:** Two years of research into DeFi, focusing on exchanges on EVM, Cosmos, and NEAR blockchains.
- **Simulation Codes:** Developed to serve as model testing tools during development and audits.
- **Case Study - Cross-Border Payments:** Analyzed incentive compatibility using ABM techniques.

###### Play-to-Earn
[Alien Fungi](https://github.com/imxm/Token-Engineering/tree/main/alienFungi)
- **Description**: A play-to-earn game where players grow, trade, and battle unique fungal species. The project includes a detailed tokenomics model focused on incentivizing player engagement and creating a balanced in-game economy.

###### Metaverse
[Astra](https://github.com/imxm/Token-Engineering/tree/main/astra)
- **Description**: A metaverse project designed to create an immersive virtual world with its own economy. The tokenomics involve creating a sustainable ecosystem where users can buy, sell, and trade virtual assets.

###### DeFi Infrastructure
[Elektirk](https://github.com/imxm/Token-Engineering/tree/main/elektirk)
- **Description**: A decentralized exchange (DEX) infrastructure project focused on advanced trading strategies such as Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) orders. The project aims to optimize trading mechanisms in decentralized markets.

[LBP-LL (Liquidity Bootstrapping for LightLink)](https://github.com/imxm/Token-Engineering/tree/main/LBP-LL)
- **Description**: A liquidity bootstrapping project utilizing Balancer‚Äôs Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) mechanism, specifically tailored for the LightLink ecosystem. It focuses on optimizing initial token distribution and liquidity provisioning.

[LL-Airdrop](https://github.com/imxm/Token-Engineering/tree/main/LL_Airdrop)
- **Description**: Airdrop strategy and tokenomics for the LightLink ecosystem. This project outlines the distribution mechanics and incentives for early adopters and contributors within the LightLink network.

###### Cross-Border Payments
[MIDL](https://github.com/imxm/Token-Engineering/tree/main/MIDL)
- **Description**: A cross-border payment solution leveraging decentralized, crypto-backed custodians to facilitate international transactions. The tokenomics are designed to reduce costs and increase the efficiency of global payments.

###### Miscellaneous
[Push the Button](https://github.com/imxm/Token-Engineering/tree/main/PushTheButton)
- **Description**: A unique experimental project involving game theory and community participation. Participants are incentivized through token rewards based on their timing and decisions in a communal game of "Push the Button."

[Script TV](https://github.com/imxm/Token-Engineering/tree/main/script%20Tv)
